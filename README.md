This is a research project for a course in Continous Dynamical Systems. It was collaborative with Joseph Diaz. We decided to look at and learn about the DLDMD, Deep Learning Dynamic Mode Decomposition. [Jay Lago, https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04433 ]

Our research paper of our findings can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Pltk_F3AyVlBES0_kiUMldJl0pATp0i7/view?usp=sharing
